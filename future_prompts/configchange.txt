Make the following updates. Make them end to end so the project doesnt break. the changes are as follows:
Currently we have test/batch_....json that we pass in the command line when runnning the project. This serves as a config file for how we want the game to run.
There are 3 major categories included in this config file. Our goal now is to separate them for organizational purposes.
The three main categories are game,llm and opponent

Game will store game specific config such as logging, number of games, which side starts where (llm_color) etc. 

llm will store llm specific config, such as model, prompting style (batch or parrallel) and things specific to building the prompt.

Finally the opponent config will contain variables specific to the opponent against the llm. These include engine path, depth
